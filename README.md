# 🚖 Zuber: Ride-Sharing Market Analysis in Chicago

## 🔍 Project Functionality
This project analyzes public transportation data in Chicago to uncover patterns that can help Zuber, a new ride-hailing startup, compete effectively in the market. The main goals are to identify popular destinations, understand market leaders, and evaluate the impact of weather conditions on trip duration. The analysis involves cleaning, exploring, visualizing data, and testing statistical hypotheses to support strategic decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Methods
Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

Descriptive analytics: trip counts, company rankings, neighborhood popularity

Data visualization: bar charts, histogram and comparative graphs to support insights

**Hypothesis testing:**

Null hypothesis: Weather does not affect trip duration.

Statistical tests: Levene’s test for variance equality, followed by independent t-test for comparing mean trip durations

Focused on trips from The Loop to O'Hare Airport on rainy vs. non-rainy Saturdays

## 📈 Key Findings and Conclusion
Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, and Medallion Leasing dominate the market in number of trips, with Flash Cab leading overall.

The Loop and River North neighborhoods are the busiest in terms of trip completions, likely due to commercial and residential density.

Trip durations are significantly longer on rainy Saturdays, confirming the alternative hypothesis.

**Recommendations for Zuber:**

Increase presence in key neighborhoods during peak hours.

Monitor competitors’ pricing and promotional strategies.

Use weather-based predictions to inform riders of delays, adjust fares, or optimize routes.
